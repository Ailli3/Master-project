# Main problem discussed
Due to poor NB (neighbor balance) and ED (even distribution), sub-optimal design will be rejected, even each row and each column forms a binary block, that is, no treatment occurs more than once in a column or row. 

# Concepts before algrithm

## Blocking structures: grouping of rows and columns.(?)
Generally we have a rectangle experiment field with $k$ rows and $s$ columns and assume that $k\leq s$. Grouping rows and columns into $g_k$  row-groups and $g_s$ column-groups, respectively. this move is to achieve ED in experimental area.

## Criteria evaluated
Three criteria we want to compare between designs

1. The average efficiency factor $\bar{f}_A^{RC}$, can be measured as average pairwise variance of the design. Article mention $\bar{f}_A$ [@williams2015optimality] calculated as following formula
$$
\bar{f}_A=\bar{g}_A\frac{\bar{r}_a}{\bar{r}_h}
$$
here $r_i$ is the replicated time for every treatment, $\bar{r}_a$ is the arithmetic mean of the $r_i$ and $\bar{r}_h$ is the harmonic mean. It is a a scaled form of $\bar{g}_A$ for ease of comparison. When it comes to $\bar{g}_A$ Williams mentioned its relation with A-criteria. We have
$$
\bar{g}_A = \frac{1}{\bar{r}_a\mathscr{A}}
$$
Here $\mathscr{A}$ is the A-criteria we have. So the average efficiency factor can be measured by A-criteria. I suppose we may use $\frac{1}{\mathscr{A}}$ to define 

2. Using Euclidean distances in terms of row and column numbers to measure the ED. $MST_i$ is the arithmetic mean length of the lines of a minimum spanning tree connecting all replications of the treatment $i$

3. NB is evaluated by number of treatment pairs.(?)

We need to find a good balance between these three standards.

# Generating design using linear-mixed model

## linear-mixed model
The linear-mixed model we are discussing

$$
y=\textbf{X}\tau+\textbf{Z}u+\epsilon
$$
we would like to optimize the treatment information matrix $\textbf{X}^\top \textbf{P}\textbf{X}$, $\textbf{P}$ matrix is the inverse of the covariance matrix of $y$ we denote is as $\textbf{V}$ and $\textbf{V}=\textbf{Z}\textbf{G}\textbf{Z}^\top+\textbf{R}$, $\textbf{G}$ and $\textbf{R}$ are variance-covariance matrices of random effects and error.

In the article, Williams replaced $\textbf{Z}\mu+\epsilon$ with $f$ and and taking row groups and column groups into consideration, that is 
$$
f= \textbf{Z}_Ru_R+\textbf{Z}_Cu_C+\textbf{Z}_{RG}u_{RG}+\textbf{Z}_{CG}u_{CG}+\epsilon
$$

## Direct optimization of ED and NB
Defining six type of self-adjacency, and start with an efficient row-column design,which can be found by algorithm with average efficiency factor we choose, such as A-criteria we have at hand. and improve nine scores that measure ED and NB.Row minimum span and column minimum span are also included to evaluate ED. 

But here we only optimize $S1$ (diagonal self-adjacencies), $S2$ (Number of row-neighbor occurrences), row minimum span and column minimum span, and $\bar{f}_A^{RC}=\frac{1}{\mathscr{A}}$. We don't want $S1$ and $S2$ to be large and we are expecting row minimum span, column minimum span and average efficiency factor to be as large as possible.

# Interchange algorithm basing on scoring system

## Algorithm described in article

1. Suppose we have a rectangle experiment field have several row and columns. Firstly, we divide column into column-groups, and in each column-group the number of plots may less than the number of treatment. And optimize $S1$ and $S2$ for the design with interchanges.

2. Using interchanges (or permutations I suppose) within a column-group to optimize the value in the scoring system. To be specific, improving column spans without affecting $S1$ and $S2$ we previously have. And also optimize the row spans.

3. To determine whether we accept the new design or not, we have to steps:

a) $S1$, $S2$,  minimum row span and minimum column span are better than current design.

b) The average efficiency factor $\bar{f}_A^{RC}$ is larger than current design.

## Algorithm I have in mind

1. Using A-criteria and simulated annealing to generate an efficient row-column design (sub-optimal).

2. Do step 1 in  Algorithm described in article. As it is written in article - without degrading any earlier criteria.

3. Optimize minimum row span and minimum column span without without affecting $S1$ and $S2$.

4. Calculating A-criteria for the new design, but this time we may need to use
$$
f= \textbf{Z}_Ru_R+\textbf{Z}_Cu_C+\textbf{Z}_{RG}u_{RG}+\textbf{Z}_{CG}u_{CG}+\epsilon
$$
to calculate $\textbf{V}$ matrix and $\textbf{P}$ matrix because now we are considering column-groups and row-groups.

5. Collecting values of the criteria - A-criteria (The average efficiency factor we use), minimum of $MST_i$ of all treatment and number of treatment pairs. We are expecting a better values for these criteria. Go back to step 2 and step 3 if it is larger. However, According to the example given by Williams, to achieve a better ED and NB, average efficiency factor might be worse. So we need a tolerance for such changing.

# Questions about article and algorithm

## For article

1. Cannot understand 2 options in section 3.3, seems that it plays an important role in optimization.

2. Divisible method and filter method mentioned in article. Not sure if my understanding is right.

3. Why we need  grouping of rows and columns? And how to achieve ED and NB between groups? 

## For Algorithms

1. The relation between two design strategies given by Williams. I think they are two distinct algorithm. Or they can be combined.

2. How to achieve "without degrading any earlier criteria"? Specifically speaking, for example, how to maintain $S1$ and $S2$ when we are doing interchanges within column-groups. Is A-criteria changing when we are optimizing $S1$ and $S2$?

3. How to update design? I suppose we can start with the design have better values of the criteria.

4. One specific part of algorithms in article: "The starting design is now randomized to produce a new starting design and the program returns to step 1 above. This whole
procedure is repeated 50 times. When this stage is completed the starting designs continue to be randomized with the program
returning to step 1 each time."
