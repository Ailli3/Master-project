# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Row-Column designs are widely used in experimental design to minimize variance and improve estimation accuracy. However, it sometimes can lead to clustering of treatments, which negatively impacts design efficiency. we present an approach to optimizing row-column designs using the A-criterion, while avoiding clustering simultaneously through the application of random search and simulated annealing algorithm. Our method introduces some statistical criteria to quantify spatial distribution, and by incorporating these metrics into the two mentioned algorithms, we effectively balance the optimization between treatment efficiency and spatial distribution. Additionally, we compare the performance of the different algorithms, demonstrating their relative effectiveness. This work contributes to both the theory and practice of experimental design by offering an improved methodology for achieving optimal and evenly distributed arrangements.
